# Build Your Own Shell  

This project implements a **POSIX-compliant shell**, providing a command-line interface to interpret and execute shell commands, run external programs, and manage processes.

---

## Features  

### 1. Command Interpretation  
- Parses and interprets standard shell commands.  
- Executes both external programs and builtin commands.  

### 2. Builtin Commands  
Implements common shell builtin commands, including:  
- **`cd`**: Change the current working directory.  
- **`pwd`**: Display the current working directory.  
- **`echo`**: Print text or variables to the console.  

### 3. REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)  
- Provides an interactive shell environment for command execution.  
- Continuously reads input, evaluates commands, and prints results.  

### 4. Process Management  
- Runs external programs and handles process creation and termination.

## Learning Outcomes  

This project focuses on key shell development concepts:  
- **Command Parsing**: Learn how shells parse and interpret complex commands.  
- **Builtin Commands**: Understand how to implement and handle internal shell commands.  
- **Process Handling**: Gain insights into managing system processes using system calls.  
- **REPL Design**: Explore how shells maintain an interactive loop for user inputs and outputs.
